# Math Microservice
# Cotta Bogdan - Nicolae
This project is a production-ready, containerized microservice developed with FastAPI. It exposes a RESTful API for executing basic mathematical operations — including exponentiation, factorial calculation, and Fibonacci sequence generation — and persists request logs in a local SQLite database.

## Features

- FastAPI-based REST API
- Asynchronous SQLite database access using SQLAlchemy and aiosqlite
- Request logging with timestamp and operation tracking
- Health check endpoint for infrastructure readiness probes
- Dockerized for portable deployment
